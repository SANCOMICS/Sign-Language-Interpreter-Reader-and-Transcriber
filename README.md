# KEYPOINT CLASSIFICATION IPYNB


1. Load and Preprocess the Data:
Dataset: Reads gesture/keypoint data from keypoint.csv. Each sample consists of:

Features: 42 numerical values (representing 21 2D keypoints, e.g., from a hand tracking model like MediaPipe).
Labels: A single integer (the gesture class label, ranging from 0 to 25 for 26 classes, assuming A-Z gestures).
Invalid Label Check: Identifies and prints labels that exceed the defined NUM_CLASSES (26).

Train-Test Split: Splits the dataset into:

X_train, X_test (features for training and testing)
y_train, y_test (labels for training and testing)
Ensures 75% of the data is used for training.
2. Define and Compile the Model:
Architecture: A simple feed-forward neural network:

Input Layer: 42 features (21 keypoints Ã— 2 dimensions).
Hidden Layers:
Two Dense layers with 20 and 10 units respectively, using ReLU activation.
Dropout layers (20% and 40%) to reduce overfitting.
Output Layer: A Dense layer with 26 units, using a softmax activation to predict gesture classes (one-hot probabilities).
Compilation:

Loss Function: sparse_categorical_crossentropy for multi-class classification.
Optimizer: Adam optimizer for efficient training.
Metrics: Tracks accuracy during training and evaluation.
3. Train the Model:
Callbacks:

Checkpoint Callback: Saves the best model during training to keypoint_classifier.keras.
